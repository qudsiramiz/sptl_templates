The �?�?�?®rst part of the present paper examines further probabilistic properties of the distribution, with special emphasis on aspects of statistical relevance. Inferential and other statistical issues are discussed in the following part, with applications to some multivariate statistics problems, illustrated by numerical examples.

The exact expressions of all measures of skewness, except for Songâ�?�?s, are derived for the family of skew-normal distributions, while Songâ�?�?s measure of shape is approximated by the use of delta method. The behavior of these measures, their similarities and differences, possible interpretations, and their practical use in testing for multivariate normal are studied by evaluating their power in the case of some specific members of the multivariate skew-normal family of distributions.},

  abstract  = {During the solar minimum, when the Sun is at its least active, the solar wind1,2 is observed at high latitudes as a predominantly fast (more than 500?kilometres per second), highly Alfv{\'e}nic rarefied stream of plasma originating from deep within coronal holes. Closer to the ecliptic plane, the solar wind is interspersed with a more variable slow wind3 of less than 500 kilometres per second. The precise origins of the slow wind streams are less certain4; theories and observations suggest that they may originate at the tips of helmet streamers5,6, from interchange reconnection near coronal hole boundaries7,8, or within coronal holes with highly diverging magnetic fields9,10. The heating mechanism required to drive the solar wind is also unresolved, although candidate mechanisms include Alfv{\'e}n-wave turbulence11,12, heating by reconnection in nanoflares13, ion cyclotron wave heating14 and acceleration by thermal gradients1. At a distance of one astronomical unit, the wind is mixed and evolved, and therefore much of the diagnostic structure of these sources and processes has been lost. Here we present observations from the Parker Solar Probe15 at 36 to 54 solar radii that show evidence of slow Alfv{\'e}nic solar wind emerging from a small equatorial coronal hole. The measured magnetic field exhibits patches of large, intermittent reversals that are associated with jets of plasma and enhanced Poynting flux and that are interspersed in a smoother and less turbulent flow with a near-radial magnetic field. Furthermore, plasma-wave measurements suggest the existence of electron and ion velocity-space micro-instabilities10,16 that are associated with plasma heating and thermalization processes. Our measurements suggest that there is an impulsive mechanism associated with solar-wind energization and that micro-instabilities play a part in heating, and we provide evidence that low-latitude coronal holes are a key source of the slow solar wind.},

  abstract  = {It is shown that the low frequency plasma wave equation can be obtained much more directly than by the previously used method of solving for the determinant of a matrix involving the three components of the electric field vector. The more direct method uses a two-dimensional current density vector space that is precisely equivalent to the previously used three-dimensional electric field vector space. Unlike the electric field, the current density is restricted by the quasi-neutrality condition to a two-dimensional vector space. Comparison with previously obtained dispersion relations is provided and a method is presented for obtaining exact analytic solutions for the three roots of the cubic dispersion relation. The commonly used kinetic Alfvén dispersion relation is shown to be valid only for near-perpendicular propagation in a low beta plasma. It is shown that at a cross-over point where the perpendicular wave phase velocity equals the ion acoustic velocity, the coupling between Alfvén and fast modes vanishes and the Alfvén mode reverts to its cold form even in situations where the Alfvén velocity is smaller than the electron thermal velocity. A method is prescribed by which measurement of wave electric current density completely eliminates the space-time ambiguity previously believed to be an unavoidable shortcoming of single-spacecraft frequency measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been conjectured that strong current sheets are the sites of proton heating in the solar wind. For the present study, a strong current sheet is defined by a >45° rotation of the solar-wind magnetic-field direction in 128 s. A total of 194,070 strong current sheets at 1 AU are analyzed in the 1998-2010 ACE solar-wind data set. The proton temperature, proton specific entropy, and electron temperature at each current sheet are compared with the same quantities in the plasmas adjacent to the current sheet. Statistically, the plasma at the current sheets is not hotter or of higher entropy than the plasmas just outside the current sheets. This is taken as evidence that there is no significant localized heating of the solar-wind protons or electrons at strong current sheets. Current sheets are, however, found to be more prevalent in hotter solar-wind plasma. This is because more current sheets are counted in the fast solar wind than in the slow solar wind, and the fast solar wind is hotter than the slow solar wind.},

For this period, SWOOPS instrument data obtained when the magnetic field was approximately aligned with the radial di- rection from the Sun have been analyzed. In the fast wind at high latitudes, two resolvable proton components are typi- cally present. Statistical studies of the relative densities and the field- aligned velocity difference, Vo, of the two compo- nents are carried out, considering the dependence on dis- tance from the Sun, the local Alfvâ�?¢n speed, and the type of solar wind flow. The observed values of vo/vâ�?¢i, where vâ�?¢i is the local Alfvâ�?¢n speed, are less than the upper bound de- termined from the linear theory for electromagnetic proton- proton instabilities. This result is good evidence that these microinstabilities constrain the relative streaming of the two components in the solar wind.},

  abstract  = {Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS), a NASA four-spacecraft constellation mission launched on March 12, 2015, will investigate magnetic reconnection in the boundary regions of the Earth's magnetosphere, particularly along its dayside boundary with the solar wind and the neutral sheet in the magnetic tail. The most important goal of MMS is to conduct a definitive experiment to determine what causes magnetic field lines to reconnect in a collisionless plasma. The significance of the MMS results will extend far beyond the Earth's magnetosphere because reconnection is known to occur in interplanetary space and in the solar corona where it is responsible for solar flares and the disconnection events known as coronal mass ejections. Active research is also being conducted on reconnection in the laboratory and specifically in magnetic-confinement fusion devices in which it is a limiting factor in achieving and maintaining electron temperatures high enough to initiate fusion. Finally, reconnection is proposed as the cause of numerous phenomena throughout the universe such as comet-tail disconnection events, magnetar flares, supernova ejections, and dynamics of neutron-star accretion disks. The MMS mission design is focused on answering specific questions about reconnection at the Earth's magnetosphere. The prime focus of the mission is on determining the kinetic processes occurring in the electron diffusion region that are responsible for reconnection and that determine how it is initiated; but the mission will also place that physics into the context of the broad spectrum of physical processes associated with reconnection. Connections to other disciplines such as solar physics, astrophysics, and laboratory plasma physics are expected to be made through theory and modeling as informed by the MMS results.},

It is suggested that small velocity discontinuities play a fundamental role in reducing stresses in the interplanetary medium, and that large-velocity discontinuities may give rise to waves and turbulence.},

  abstract  = {We study the propagation, reflection, and turbulent dissipation of Alfvén waves in coronal holes and the solar wind. We start with the Heinemann-Olbert equations, which describe non-compressive magnetohydrodynamic fluctuations in an inhomogeneous medium with a background flow parallel to the background magnetic field. Following the approach of Dmitruk et al., we model the nonlinear terms in these equations using a simple phenomenology for the cascade and dissipation of wave energy and assume that there is much more energy in waves propagating away from the Sun than waves propagating toward the Sun. We then solve the equations analytically for waves with periods of hours and longer to obtain expressions for the wave amplitudes and turbulent heating rate as a function of heliocentric distance. We also develop a second approximate model that includes waves with periods of roughly one minute to one hour, which undergo less reflection than the longer-period waves, and compare our models to observations. Our models generalize the phenomenological model of Dmitruk et al. by accounting for the solar wind velocity, so that the turbulent heating rate can be evaluated from the coronal base out past the Alfvén critical point�??that is, throughout the region in which most of the heating and acceleration occurs. The simple analytical expressions that we obtain can be used to incorporate Alfvén-wave reflection and turbulent heating into fluid models of the solar wind.},

  abstract  = {Protons in the solar corona and heliosphere exhibit anisotropic velocity distributions, violation of magnetic moment conservation, and a general lack of thermal equilibrium with the other particle species. There is no agreement about the identity of the physical processes that energize non-Maxwellian protons in the solar wind, but a traditional favorite has been the dissipation of ion cyclotron resonant Alfvén waves. This paper presents kinetic models of how ion cyclotron waves heat protons on their journey from the corona to interplanetary space. It also derives a wide range of new solutions for the relevant dispersion relations, marginal stability boundaries, and nonresonant velocity-space diffusion rates. A phenomenological model containing both cyclotron damping and turbulent cascade is constructed to explain the suppression of proton heating at low alpha-proton differential flow speeds. These effects are implemented in a large-scale model of proton thermal evolution from the corona to 1 AU. A Monte Carlo ensemble of realistic wind speeds, densities, magnetic field strengths, and heating rates produces a filled region of parameter space (in a plane described by the parallel plasma beta and the proton temperature anisotropy ratio) similar to what is measured. The high-beta edges of this filled region are governed by plasma instabilities and strong heating rates. The low-beta edges correspond to weaker proton heating and a range of relative contributions from cyclotron resonance. On balance, the models are consistent with other studies that find only a small fraction of the turbulent power spectrum needs to consist of ion cyclotron waves.},

  abstract  = {In the parts of the solar corona and solar wind that experience the fewest Coulomb collisions, the component proton, electron, and heavy ion populations are not in thermal equilibrium with one another. Observed differences in temperatures, outflow speeds, and velocity distribution anisotropies are useful constraints on proposed explanations for how the plasma is heated and accelerated. This paper presents new predictions of the rates of collisionless heating for each particle species, in which the energy input is assumed to come from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. We first created an empirical description of the radial evolution of Alfvén, fast-mode, and slow-mode MHD waves. This model provides the total wave power in each mode as a function of distance along an expanding flux tube in the high-speed solar wind. Next, we solved a set of cascade advection-diffusion equations that give the time-steady wavenumber spectra at each distance. An approximate term for nonlinear coupling between the Alfvén and fast-mode fluctuations is included. For reasonable choices of the parameters, our model contains enough energy transfer from the fast mode to the Alfvén mode to excite the high-frequency ion cyclotron resonance. This resonance is efficient at heating protons and other ions in the direction perpendicular to the background magnetic field, and our model predicts heating rates for these species that agree well with both spectroscopic and in situ measurements. Nonetheless, the high-frequency waves comprise only a small part of the total Alfvénic fluctuation spectrum, which remains highly two dimensional as is observed in interplanetary space.},

  abstract  = {We present a comprehensive model of the global properties of Alfvén waves in the solar atmosphere and the fast solar wind. Linear non-WKB wave transport equations are solved from the photosphere to a distance past the orbit of the Earth, and for wave periods ranging from 3 s to 3 days. We derive a radially varying power spectrum of kinetic and magnetic energy fluctuations for waves propagating in both directions along a superradially expanding magnetic flux tube. This work differs from previous models in three major ways. (1) In the chromosphere and low corona, the successive merging of flux tubes on granular and supergranular scales is described using a two-dimensional magnetostatic model of a network element. Below a critical flux-tube merging height the waves are modeled as thin-tube kink modes, and we assume that all of the kink-mode wave energy is transformed into volume-filling Alfvén waves above the merging height. (2) The frequency power spectrum of horizontal motions is specified only at the photosphere, based on prior analyses of G-band bright point kinematics. Everywhere else in the model the amplitudes of outward and inward propagating waves are computed with no free parameters. We find that the wave amplitudes in the corona agree well with off-limb nonthermal line-width constraints. (3) Nonlinear turbulent damping is applied to the results of the linear model using a phenomenological energy loss term. A single choice for the normalization of the turbulent outer-scale length produces both the right amount of damping at large distances (to agree with in situ measurements) and the right amount of heating in the extended corona (to agree with empirically constrained solar wind acceleration models). In the corona, the modeled heating rate differs by more than an order of magnitude from a rate based on isotropic Kolmogorov turbulence.},

  abstract  = {We present a series of models for the plasma properties along open magnetic flux tubes rooted in solar coronal holes, streamers, and active regions. These models represent the first self-consistent solutions that combine (1) chromospheric heating driven by an empirically guided acoustic wave spectrum; (2) coronal heating from Alfvén waves that have been partially reflected, then damped by anisotropic turbulent cascade; and (3) solar wind acceleration from gradients of gas pressure, acoustic wave pressure, and Alfvén wave pressure. The only input parameters are the photospheric lower boundary conditions for the waves and the radial dependence of the background magnetic field along the flux tube. We have not included multifluid or collisionless effects (e.g., preferential ion heating), which are not yet fully understood. For a single choice for the photospheric wave properties, our models produce a realistic range of slow and fast solar wind conditions by varying only the coronal magnetic field. Specifically, a two-dimensional model of coronal holes and streamers at solar minimum reproduces the latitudinal bifurcation of slow and fast streams seen by Ulysses. The radial gradient of the Alfvén speed affects where the waves are reflected and damped, and thus whether energy is deposited below or above the Parker critical point. As predicted by earlier studies, a larger coronal "expansion factor" gives rise to a slower and denser wind, higher temperature at the coronal base, less intense Alfvén waves at 1 AU, and correlative trends for commonly measured ratios of ion charge states and FIP-sensitive abundances that are in general agreement with observations. These models offer supporting evidence for the idea that coronal heating and solar wind acceleration (in open magnetic flux tubes) can occur as a result of wave dissipation and turbulent cascade.},

A turbulent energy cascade to small length scales perpendicular to the mean magnetic field can be sustained by driving with low-frequency Alfvén waves reflected from mean density and magnetic field gradients. This mechanism deposits energy efficiently in the lower corona, and we show that the spatial distribution of the heating is determined by the mean density through the Alfvén speed profile. This provides a robust heating mechanism which can explain observed high coronal temperatures and accounts for the significant heating (per unit volume) distribution below 2 solar radii needed in models of the origin of the solar wind. The obtained heating per unit mass, on the other hand, is much more extended, indicating that the heating on a per-particle basis persists throughout all the lower coronal region considered here.},

In the absence of collisional viscosity, the dynamics at small scales is presumably kinetic in nature; the identification of the physical mechanism which replaces energy dissipation and establishes the link between macroscopic and microscopic scales would open a new scenario in the study of turbulent heating in space plasmas. We present a numerical analysis of kinetic effects along the turbulent energy cascade in solar-wind plasmas which provides an effective unified interpretation of a wide set of spacecraft observations and shows that, simultaneously with an increase in the ion perpendicular temperature, strong bursts of electrostatic activity in the form of
ion-acoustic turbulence are produced together with accelerated beams in the ion distribution function.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Intervals of enhanced magnetic fluctuations have been frequently observed in the solar wind. But it remains an open question as to whether these waves are generated at the Sun and then transported outward by the solar wind or generated locally in the interplanetary medium. Magnetic field and plasma measurements from the Wind spacecraft under slow solar wind conditions on 19 March 2005 demonstrate seven events of enhanced magnetic fluctuations at spacecraft-frame frequencies somewhat above the proton cyclotron frequency and propagation approximately parallel or antiparallel to the background magnetic field Bo. The proton velocity distributions during these events are characterized by two components: a more dense, slower core and a less dense, faster beam. Observed plasma parameters are used in a kinetic linear dispersion equation analysis for electromagnetic fluctuations at k x Bo�??=�??0; for two events the most unstable mode is the Alfvén-cyclotron instability driven by a proton component temperature anisotropy T�?�/T||�??>�??1 (where the subscripts denote directions relative to Bo), and for three events the most unstable mode is the right-hand polarized magnetosonic instability driven primarily by ion component relative flows. Thus, both types of ion anisotropies and both types of instabilities are likely to be local sources of these enhanced fluctuation events in the solar wind.},

This manuscript uses one-dimensional hybrid simulations of the proton cyclotron anisotropy instability in homogeneous electron-proton plasmas to study this correlation which may represent a limited closure relation for fluid theories of anisotropic space plasmas. The emphasis is on driven simulations which increase the temperature anisotropy by periodically reducing the magnetic-field-aligned velocities of the protons. The late-time states from ensembles of both initial value and driven simulations yield very similar expressions for the proton anisotropy/β�?�p inverse correlation, and provide a basis for explaining differences between sheath observations from different spacecraft. The driven simulations also yield expressions for the maximum instability growth rate and the fluctuating field energy as functions of β�?�p and a parameter characterizing the anisotropy driver.},

We confirm the ability of the ion cyclotron and firehose instabilities to enhance or suppress reconnection, respectively. The simulations demonstrate the emergence of persistent 3D structures, including patchy reconnection sites and the fast growth of a narrow-band drift-kink instability, which suppresses reconnection for thin current sheets with weak guide fields. Potential observational signatures of the 3D evolution of solar wind current sheets are also discussed. We conclude that kinetic instabilities, arising from non-Maxwellian ion populations, are significant to the evolution of 3D current sheets, and two-dimensional studies of heating rates by reconnection may therefore over-estimate the ability of thin, ion-scale current sheets to heat the solar wind by reconnection.},

The nonlinear dispersion relation for the mode coupling in a characteristic magnetospheric scenario is then derived and the parametric decays of the EICW are analyzed. The linear stability of the circularly polarized waves in a solar wind type plasma is then discussed and the dispersion relation of Hollweg et al. (1993) is briefly reviewed. The authors study the nonlinear stability of the alpha particle branch of the dispersion relation, and the nonlinear stability of the proton branch for frequencies of the pump wave close to the proton resonance. Finally, return to the alpha branch to illustrate a number of cases of interest.},

  abstract  = {The fluctuating magnetic helicity is considered an important parameter in diagnosing the characteristic modes of solar wind turbulence. Among them is the Alfvén-cyclotron wave, which is probably responsible for the solar wind plasma heating, but has not yet been identified from the magnetic helicity of solar wind turbulence. Here, we present the possible signatures of Alfvén-cyclotron waves in the distribution of magnetic helicity as a function of θVB, which is the angle between the solar wind velocity and local mean magnetic field. We use magnetic field data from the STEREO spacecraft to calculate the θVB distribution of the normalized reduced fluctuating magnetic helicity �?m. We find a dominant negative �?m for 1 s 150° in the solar wind inward magnetic sector. These features of �?m appearing around the Doppler-shifted ion-cyclotron frequencies may be consistent with the existence of Alfvén-cyclotron waves among the outward propagating fluctuations. Moreover, right-handed polarized waves at larger propagation angles, which might be kinetic Alfvén waves or whistler waves, have also been identified on the basis of the �?m features in the angular range 40° < θVB < 140°. Our findings suggest that Alfvén-cyclotron waves (together with other wave modes) play a prominent role in turbulence cascading and plasma heating of the solar wind.},

  volume    = {113},
  abstract  = {Oblique fire hose instability is investigated using hybrid simulations for proton betas of the order of one and for proton parallel temperatures sufficiently greater than the perpendicular ones. The simulations confirm previous simulation results showing that this instability has self-destructing properties and efficiently reduces the proton temperature anisotropy. A parametric study using one-dimensional standard hybrid simulations shows that stronger changes in the temperature anisotropy and stronger wave emissions appear for larger initial temperature anisotropies. An ideal, slow plasma expansion, modeled by a two-dimensional hybrid expanding box simulation, leads to a generation of proton temperature anisotropy. The anisotropy leads first to destabilization of the dominant parallel fire hose, which interacts mainly with minor supra-Alfvénic protons, whereas the evolution of core protons is determined by expansion. Consequently, the effective anisotropy is only slightly reduced and the system eventually becomes unstable with respect to the oblique fire hose instability. The oblique fire hose strongly scatters the protons and removes the anisotropy disrupting the parallel fire hose. An important portion of the fluctuating wave energy is dissipated to protons, and only long wavelength waves remain in the system. The system with low wave activity then develops again larger temperature anisotropies, and the evolution repeats itself. It is concluded that both parallel and oblique proton fire hose instabilities constrain the proton temperature anisotropy in the expanding solar wind, with the latter one constituting a final frontier for the anisotropy. These results give a possible explanation of some apparent discrepancies between observations and linear predictions. In addition, a simple bounded anisotropy model is developed to include some of the kinetic effects of the fire hose instabilities in fluid models.},

  abstract  = {We develop a series of new analytical expressions describing the physical properties of the kinetic Alfvén wave. The wave becomes strongly compressive when is of the order of the ion inertial length. Thus, in a low-β plasma, the kinetic Alfvén wave can be compressive at values of k�?� for which the dispersion relation departs only slightly from that of the usual MHD Alfvén wave. The compression is accompanied by a magnetic field fluctuation δB�?? such that the total pressure perturbation δptot �?? 0. Thus the wave undergoes transit-time damping as well as Landau damping; the two effects are comparable if the ion thermal speed is of the order of the Alfvén speed. We find that the transverse electric field is elliptically polarized but rotating in the electron sense; this surprising behavior of the polarization of the Alfvén branch was discovered numerically by Gary [1986]. We derive a new dispersion relation which explicitly shows how the kinetic Alfvén wave takes on some properties of the large-k�?� limit of the slow mode. We also derive approximate dispersion relations valid for a multi-ion plasma with differential streaming. We suggest that the kinetic Alfvén wave may be responsible for the flattening of density fluctuation spectra observed at large wavenumbers in the corona and in the solar wind. We also find that our derived properties of the kinetic Alfvén wave are consistent with its presence in the dissipation range of MHD turbulence [Leamon et al., 1998a, b].},

  abstract  = {Previous wave-driven solar wind models (Hollweg, 1978) have been extended by including a new hypothesis for the nonlinear wave dissipation. The hypothesis is that the waves dissipate via a turbulent cascade at the rate given by (1) and the waves evolve according to (16). A subhypothesis is that the relevant correlation length scales as the distance between magnetic field lines. This hypothesis allows us to treat the corona and the solar wind on an equal footing; unlike in previous wave-driven models, we do not assume that the coronal heating takes place below the base of the model. The models exhibit the correct qualitative features, viz., a steep temperature rise (the transition region) to a maximum coronal temperature in excess of 106 K, and a substantial solar wind mass flux in excess of 3.5�?108 cm�??2 s�??1 at 1 AU. However, the model fails in detail. Parameters that yield a high-speed flow at 1 AU have base pressures that are too low; parameters that yield correct base pressures have low solar wind flow speeds. However, the model �??comes close.�?� Thus although we have not shown that the initial hypothesis is consistent with available data, we feel that there are sufficient uncertainties both in the model and in the data to preclude outright rejection of the hypothesis altogether.},

  abstract  = {We analytically consider how velocity shear in the corona and solar wind can cause an initial Alfvén wave to drive up other propagating signals. The process is similar to the familiar coupling into other modes induced by non-WKB refraction in an inhomogeneous plasma, except here the refraction is a consequence of velocity shear. We limit our discussion to a low-beta plasma, and ignore couplings into signals resembling the slow mode. If the initial Alfvén wave is propagating nearly parallel to the background magnetic field, then the induced signals are mainly a forward-going (i.e., propagating in the same sense as the original Alfvén wave) fast mode, and a driven signal propagating like a forward-going Alfvén wave but polarized like the fast mode; both signals are compressive and subject to damping by the Landau resonance. For an initial Alfvén wave propagating obliquely with respect to the magnetic field, the induced signals are mainly forward- and backward-going fast modes, and a driven signal propagating like a forward-going Alfvén wave but polarized like the fast mode; these signals are all compressive and subject to damping by the Landau resonance. A backward-going Alfvén wave, thought to be important in the development of MHD turbulence, is also produced, but it is very weak. However, we suggest that for oblique propagation of the initial Alfvén wave the induced fast-polarized signal propagating like a forward-going Alfvén wave may interact coherently with the initial Alfvén wave and distort it at a strong-turbulence-like rate.},

  abstract  = {We extend the kinetic guiding-center model of collisionless coronal hole protons presented in Isenberg & Vasquez to consider driving by imbalanced spectra of obliquely propagating ion-cyclotron waves. These waves are assumed to be a small by-product of the imbalanced turbulent cascade to high perpendicular wavenumber, and their total intensity is taken to be 1% of the total fluctuation energy. We also extend the kinetic solutions for the proton distribution function in the resulting fast solar wind to heliocentric distances of 20 solar radii, which will be attainable by the Solar Probe Plus spacecraft. We consider three ratios of outward-propagating to inward-propagating resonant intensities: 1, 4, and 9. The self-consistent bulk flow speed reaches fast solar wind values in all cases, and these speeds are basically independent of the intensity ratio. The steady-state proton distribution is highly organized into nested constant-density shells by the resonant wave-particle interaction. The radial evolution of this kinetic distribution as the coronal hole plasma flows outward is understood as a competition between the inward- and outward-directed large-scale forces, causing an effective circulation of particles through the (v�?�, v�?�) phase space and a characteristic asymmetric shape to the distribution. These asymmetries are substantial and persist to the outer limit of the model computation, where they should be observable by the Solar Probe Plus instruments.},

  abstract  = {Using high-resolution magnetic field data from the STEREO mission, we have observed strong narrow-band ion cyclotron waves (ICWs) in the solar wind near 1 AU. The waves propagate nearly parallel to the magnetic field and are below the local proton gyrofrequency in the solar wind frame. Because the twin STEREO spacecraft were far away from any planet, including the Earth, the waves do not have a planetary source. The ICWs often appear when the interplanetary magnetic field is more radial than the nominal Parker spiral. Since the wave frequency in the spacecraft frame is higher than the local proton gyrofrequency, the waves are not locally generated by ion pickup. Observations are consistent with wave generation closer to the Sun and outward transport by the super-Alfvénic solar wind. The waves are intrinsically left-hand polarized in the solar wind frame, but appear to be both left- and right-handed in the spacecraft frame, associated with outward and inward propagation, respectively. The relative amplitudes of the left-handed and right-handed waves support the closer-to-Sun generation scenario.},

  abstract  = {Transverse, near-circularly polarized, parallel-propagating electromagnetic waves around the proton cyclotron frequency were found sporadically in the solar wind throughout the inner heliosphere. They could play an important role in heating and accelerating the solar wind. These low-frequency waves (LFWs) are intermittent but often occur in prolonged bursts lasting over 10 minutes, named "LFW storms." Through a comprehensive survey of them from Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory A using dynamic spectral wave analysis, we have identified 241 LFW storms in 2008, present 0.9% of the time. They are left-hand (LH) or right-hand (RH) polarized in the spacecraft frame with similar characteristics, probably due to Doppler shift of the same type of waves or waves of intrinsically different polarities. In rare cases, the opposite polarities are observed closely in time or even simultaneously. Having ruled out interplanetary coronal mass ejections, shocks, energetic particles, comets, planets, and interstellar ions as LFW sources, we discuss the remaining generation scenarios: LH ion cyclotron instability driven by greater perpendicular temperature than parallel temperature or by ring-beam distribution, and RH ion fire hose instability driven by inverse temperature anisotropy or by cool ion beams. The investigation of solar wind conditions is compromised by the bias of the one-dimensional Maxwellian fit used for plasma data calibration. However, the LFW storms are preferentially detected in rarefaction regions following fast winds and when the magnetic field is radial. This preference may be related to the ion cyclotron anisotropy instability in fast wind and the minimum in damping along the radial field.},

  abstract  = {The Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons (SWEAP) Investigation on Solar Probe Plus is a four sensor instrument suite that provides complete measurements of the electrons and ionized helium and hydrogen that constitute the bulk of solar wind and coronal plasma. SWEAP consists of the Solar Probe Cup (SPC) and the Solar Probe Analyzers (SPAN). SPC is a Faraday Cup that looks directly at the Sun and measures ion and electron fluxes and flow angles as a function of energy. SPAN consists of an ion and electron electrostatic analyzer (ESA) on the ram side of SPP (SPAN-A) and an electron ESA on the anti-ram side (SPAN-B). The SPAN-A ion ESA has a time of flight section that enables it to sort particles by their mass/charge ratio, permitting differentiation of ion species. SPAN-A and -B are rotated relative to one another so their broad fields of view combine like the seams on a baseball to view the entire sky except for the region obscured by the heat shield and covered by SPC. Observations by SPC and SPAN produce the combined field of view and measurement capabilities required to fulfill the science objectives of SWEAP and Solar Probe Plus. SWEAP measurements, in concert with magnetic and electric fields, energetic particles, and white light contextual imaging will enable discovery and understanding of solar wind acceleration and formation, coronal and solar wind heating, and particle acceleration in the inner heliosphere of the solar system. SPC and SPAN are managed by the SWEAP Electronics Module (SWEM), which distributes power, formats onboard data products, and serves as a single electrical interface to the spacecraft. SWEAP data products include ion and electron velocity distribution functions with high energy and angular resolution. Full resolution data are stored within the SWEM, enabling high resolution observations of structures such as shocks, reconnection events, and other transient structures to be selected for download after the fact. This paper describes the implementation of the SWEAP Investigation, the driving requirements for the suite, expected performance of the instruments, and planned data products, as of mission preliminary design review.},

  abstract  = {The prediction of a supersonic solar wind1 was first confirmed by spacecraft near Earth2,3 and later by spacecraft at heliocentric distances as small as 62 solar radii4. These missions showed that plasma accelerates as it emerges from the corona, aided by unidentified processes that transport energy outwards from the Sun before depositing it in the wind. Alfv{\'e}nic fluctuations are a promising candidate for such a process because they are seen in the corona and solar wind and contain considerable energy5-7. Magnetic tension forces the corona to co-rotate with the Sun, but any residual rotation far from the Sun reported until now has been much smaller than the amplitude of waves and deflections from interacting wind streams8. Here we report observations of solar-wind plasma at heliocentric distances of about 35 solar radii9-11, well within the distance at which stream interactions become important. We find that Alfv{\'e}n waves organize into structured velocity spikes with duration of up to minutes, which are associated with propagating S-like bends in the magnetic-field lines. We detect an increasing rotational component to the?flow velocity of the solar wind around the Sun, peaking at 35 to 50 kilometres per second--considerably above the amplitude of the waves. These flows exceed classical velocity predictions of a few kilometres per second, challenging models of circulation in the corona and calling into question our understanding of how stars lose angular momentum and spin down as they age12-14.},

 He on solar wind speed and solar activity between 1994 and 2010. This work updates an earlier study of A
 He from 1994 to 2004 to include the recent extreme solar minimum and broadly confirms our previous result that A
 He in slow wind is strongly correlated with sunspot number, reaching its lowest values in each solar minima. During the last minimum, as sunspot numbers reached their lowest levels in recent history, A
 He continued to decrease, falling to half the levels observed in slow wind during the previous minimum and, for the first time observed, decreasing even in the fastest solar wind. We have also extended our previous analysis by adding measurements of the mean carbon and oxygen charge states observed with the Advanced Composition Explorer spacecraft since 1998. We find that as solar activity decreased, the mean charge states of oxygen and carbon for solar wind of a given speed also fell, implying that the wind was formed in cooler regions in the corona during the recent solar minimum. The physical processes in the coronal responsible for establishing the mean charge state and speed of the solar wind have evolved with solar activity and time.},

From these comparisons, it is hypothesized that the observed signatures result from a perpendicular cascade of Alfvénic fluctuations and a local, non-turbulent population of ion-cyclotron or whistler waves generated by temperature anisotropy instabilities. By constraining the model's free parameters through comparison to in situ data, it is found that, on average, �?�95% of the power near dissipative scales is contained in a perpendicular Alfvénic cascade and that the parallel fluctuations are propagating nearly unidirectionally. The effects of aliasing on magnetic helicity measurements are considered and shown to be significant near the Nyquist frequency.},

Verdini et al. presented a model for heating and accelerating the solar wind based on the turbulent dissipation of Alfvén waves. We first use a time-dependent model of the solar wind to reproduce one of Verdini et al.'s solutions; then, we extend its application to the case where the energy equation includes thermal conduction and radiation losses, and the upper chromosphere is part of the computational domain. Using this model, we explore the parameter space and describe the characteristics of a fast solar wind solution. We discuss how this formulation may be applied to a three-dimensional MHD model of the corona and solar wind.},

  abstract  = {Kinetic microinstabilities in the solar wind arise when its non-thermal properties become too extreme. This thesis project focused specifically on the four instabilities associated with ion temperature anisotropy: the cyclotron, mirror, and parallel and oblique firehose instabilities. Numerous studies have provided evidence that proton temperature anisotropy in the solar wind is limited by the actions of these instabilities. For this project, a fully revised analysis of data from the \it{Wind} spacecraftâ�?�?s Faraday cups and calculations from linear Vlasov theory were used to extend these findings in two respects. First, theoretical thresholds were derived for $\alpha$-particle temperature anisotropy instabilities, which were then found to be consistent with a statistical analysis of Wind $\alpha$-particle data. This suggests that $\alpha$-particles, which constitute only about $5\%$ of ions in the solar wind, are nevertheless able to drive temperature anisotropy instabilities. Second, a statistical analysis of Wind proton data found that proton temperature was significantly enhanced in plasma unstable due to proton temperature anisotropy. This implies that extreme proton temperature anisotropies in solar wind at $1$ AU arise from ongoing anisotropic heating (versus cooling from, e.g., CGL double adiabatic expansion). Together, these results provide further insight into the complex evolution of the solar windâ�?�?s non-fluid properties.},

  abstract  = {We report a study of the properties of the parallel proton fire hose instability comparing the results obtained by the linear analysis, from one-dimensional (1-D) standard hybrid simulations and 1-D hybrid expanding box simulations. The three different approaches converge toward the same instability threshold condition which is in good agreement with in situ observations, suggesting that such instability is relevant in the solar wind context. We investigate also the effect of the wave-particle interactions on shaping the proton distribution function and on the evolution of the spectrum of the magnetic fluctuations during the expansion. We find that the resonant interaction can provide the proton distribution function to depart from the bi-Maxwellian form.},

The interaction of Alfvén waves, generated in the photosphere or chromosphere, with their reflections and the subsequent driving of quasi-two-dimensional MHD turbulence is considered. A nonlinear cascade drives fluctuations toward short wavelengths which are transverse to the mean field, thereby heating at rates insensitive to restrictive Alfvén timescales. A phenomenology is presented, providing estimates of achievable heating efficiency that are most favorable.},

  abstract  = {NASA's Parker Solar Probe mission1 recently plunged through the inner heliosphere of the Sun to its perihelia, about 24 million kilometres from the Sun. Previous studies farther from the Sun (performed mostly at a distance of 1 astronomical unit) indicate that solar energetic particles are accelerated from a few kiloelectronvolts up to near-relativistic energies via at least two processes: 'impulsive' events, which are usually associated with magnetic reconnection in solar flares and are typically enriched in electrons, helium-3 and heavier ions2, and 'gradual' events3,4, which are typically associated with large coronal-mass-ejection-driven shocks and compressions moving through the corona and inner solar wind?and are?the?dominant?source of protons with energies between?1 and 10 megaelectronvolts. However, some events show aspects of both processes and the electron-proton ratio is not bimodally distributed, as would be expected if there were only two possible processes5. These processes have been very difficult to resolve from prior observations, owing to the various transport effects that affect the energetic particle population en route to more distant spacecraft6. Here we report observations of the near-Sun energetic particle radiation environment over the first two orbits of the probe. We find a variety of energetic particle events accelerated both locally and remotely including by corotating interaction regions, impulsive events driven by acceleration near the Sun, and an event related to a coronal mass ejection. We provide direct observations of the energetic particle radiation environment in the region just above the corona of the Sun and directly explore the physics of particle acceleration and transport.},

  abstract  = {In situ studies of the magnetic fields in space by spacecraft (S/C) began 4 decades ago. The experiments were initially difficult to perform and interpret accurately because of contamination by S/C-generated magnetic fields, partial measurements of the vector field, limited mass and power for the instrumentation, low-data-rate sampling, discontinuous or spotty data coverage, and sometimes unknown orientation or location of the S/C. As each of these challenges was overcome, an initial view of the macrostructure of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) emerged, substantiating the Archimedean spiral structure and solar origin of the IMF as proposed theoretically by E. N. Parker. An important mesoscale feature noted early on was the sectoring of the IMF into an ordered sequence of alternating polarities associated with solar sources. Subsequent studies catalogued the microscale magnetohydrodynamic structures: shock waves, and tangential and rotational discontinuities and fluctuations. Correlations with solar photospheric magnetic fields, coronal holes and in situ plasma, and energetic particles elaborated more completely on the structure and dynamics of the IMF. This paper will provide a brief historical summary of the study of the IMF or, as it is now more commonly referred to, the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF).},

  abstract  = {Several recent studies indicate that there are very few discontinuities in the solar wind that have both the small changes in field magnitude and the large components of the magnetic field normal to the discontinuity surface that are commonly assumed to be signatures of rotational discontinuities (RDs). Those results call into question the validity of earlier studies based on the minimum variance technique for determining the direction of the normal to the discontinuity; many of those studies concluded that RDs occur more frequently than tangential discontinuities (TDs). The new results raise the question of whether the discontinuities with both small magnitude changes and small normal components are TDs with small magnitude changes or RDs with small normal components. Reexamination of an earlier study of discontinuities observed with the ISEE 3 spacecraft and consideration of the plasma jump conditions across some of the discontinuities observed by Cluster fail to give a clear answer. The pros and cons of the two interpretations are summarized.},

  abstract  = {We study the effects of plasma ? (the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure) on the evolution of kinetic plasma turbulence using fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of decaying turbulence. We find that the plasma ? systematically affects spectra, measures of intermittency, decay rates of turbulence fluctuations, and partitioning over different channels of energy exchange. More specifically, an increase in plasma ? leads to greater total heating, with proton heating preferentially more than electrons. Implications for achieving magnetosheath like temperature ratios are discussed.},

These are the first such simulations that take into account the solar-wind outflow velocity and the radial inhomogeneity of the background solar wind without approximating the nonlinear terms in the governing equations. RMHD turbulence is driven by outward-propagating Alfvén waves (z
 + fluctuations) launched from the Sun, which undergo partial non-WKB reflection to produce sunward-propagating Alfvén waves (z
 �?? fluctuations). We present 10 simulations with different values of the correlation time and perpendicular correlation length L
 �?��?? of outward-propagating Alfvén waves at the coronal base. We find that between 15% and 33% of the z
 + energy launched into the corona dissipates between the coronal base and Alfvén critical point. Between 33% and 40% of this input energy goes into work on the solar-wind outflow, and between 22% and 36% escapes as z
 + fluctuations through the simulation boundary at r = r
 A. The z

Using Parker Solar Probe data from the first encounter, we study this association using measurements of the radial proton temperature, employing the partial variance of increments (PVI) technique to identify intermittent magnetic structures. We observe that the probability density functions of high PVI events have higher median temperatures than those with lower PVI. The regions in space where PVI peaks were also locations that had enhanced temperatures when compared with similar regions, suggesting a heating mechanism in the young solar wind that is associated with intermittency developed by a nonlinear turbulent cascade in the immediate vicinity.},

In the turbulent regime, kinetic effects manifest through a deformation of the ion distribution function. These patterns of non-Maxwellian features are concentrated in space nearby regions of strong magnetic activity: the distribution function is modulated by the magnetic topology, and can elongate along or across the local magnetic field. These results open a new path on the study of kinetic processes such as heating, particle acceleration, and temperature anisotropy, commonly observed in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas.},

We make use of singular value decomposition (SVD) technique and we determine the wave vector direction, ellipticity and directions of axes of the polarization ellipse, wave refractive index, transfer function of electric antennas, estimators of the planarity of polarization, and electromagnetic planarity. Simulations of Z-mode waves, which simultaneously propagate with different wave vectors, indicate that the SVD methods give reasonable results even if the assumption on the presence of a single plane wave is invalid. Simulations of whistler mode waves show that these methods can be used to recognize cases when the waves simultaneously propagate with wave vectors in two opposite hemispheres. Finally, we show an example of analysis of natural whistler mode and Z-mode emissions measured in the high-altitude auroral region by the MEMO experiment onboard the INTERBALL spacecraft.},

The solar wind is anticipated to excite plasma microinstabilities because of its transition from collision?dominated to collisionless behavior. The applications of linear plasma theory that have been made in this field are extensively reviewed and discussed, along with our present understanding of nonlinear plasma phenomena. The solar wind is an excellent laboratory for studying many aspects of solar and plasma physics and may soon provide some answers to several fundamental questions.},

Castaing et al. (1990) have introduced the idea that this behavior can be represented, in the framework of a multiplicative cascade model, by a convolution of gaussians whose variances is distributed according to a log-normal distribution. In this letter we have tried to test this conjecture on the MHD solar wind turbulence by performing a fit of the PDF of the bulk speed and magnetic field intensity fluctuations calculated in the solar wind, with the model. This fit allows us to calculate a parameter λ² depending on the scale, which represents the width of the log-normal distribution of the variances of the gaussians. The physical implications of the obtained values of the parameter as well as of its scaling law are finally discussed.},

We investigate the relative importance of dissipation associated with collisionless damping via resonant wave-particle interactions versus dissipation in small-scale current sheets in weakly collisional plasma turbulence. Current sheets form self-consistently from the wave-driven turbulence, and their filling fraction is well correlated to the electron heating rate. However, the weakly collisional nature of the simulation necessarily implies that the current sheets are not significantly dissipated via Ohmic dissipation. Rather, collisionless damping via the Landau resonance with the electrons is sufficient to account for the measured heating as a function of scale in the simulation, without the need for significant Ohmic dissipation. This finding suggests the possibility that the dissipation of the current sheets is governed by resonant wave-particle interactions and that the locations of current sheets correspond spatially to regions of enhanced heating.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Recent observational studies show strong statistical associations between features of interplanetary suprathermal energetic particle (EP) data and rapid changes in the interplanetary vector magnetic field. The latter are connected to intermittency and coherent magnetic structures, including classical discontinuities. Here we discuss these observations in the context of two appealing theoretical ideas: First, magnetic structures bounding flux tubes can cause local or temporary topological trapping, thus influencing EP transport. Second, charged particles may be accelerated by interacting with dynamic flux tubes, either through reconnection, trapping in secondary islands, or a betatron mechanism. We present observations that support interpretation in terms of trapping boundaries associated with changes in EP flux and also find a case in which an EP peak lies near a coherent magnetic structure that is not a shock, with changing particle anisotropy consistent with outflow from the structure, suggestive of local particle acceleration.},

  abstract  = {Interplanetary discontinuities have been investigated at heliocentric distances between 1 and 8.5 AU by using Pioneer 10 and 11 vector helium magnetometer observations. The principal purpose of the study was to investigate a possible dependence of the rate of occurrence and properties of the discontinuities on radial distance. This objective required a separation of spatial and temporal variations and used the simultaneous nearly continuous data from both spacecraft. Discontinuities were identified by using carefully developed criteria that were shown to be comparable to those used in earlier studies but which are still applicable in the weak magnetic fields that are typical of large radial distances. Special attention was given to the identification of relatively thick discontinuities in the expectation that discontinuities might grow progressively thicker with distance. The statistics associated with the rate of occurrence of discontinuities have been shown to be well approximated by a Poisson distribution. The rate of occurrence of discontinuities undergoes large variations, from day to day and from one solar rotation to another, which are well outside the deviations to be expected on the basis of statistical fluctuations alone. Temporal changes in the rate of occurrence averaged over Bartels solar rotations were well correlated at Pioneer 10 and 11, which were separated by a distance of �??2 AU. The time variations consisted of a slow modulation of the rate of occurrence such that successive increases and decreases persisted for several months at a time, presumably as a result of changing solar conditions. The correlation over widely separated distances is most simply interpreted by a model in which the discontinuities originate inside 1 AU, probably near the sun, and are convected outward by the solar wind. Further support for this model is provided by the statistical properties of the discontinuities at 1 and 5 AU, which were found to be very similar. Clear evidence of a decrease in the rate of occurrence ρ with distance has been obtained. The simultaneous rates from the two spacecraft reveal that this decrease is well approximated on the average by the function ρ=50e�??(R�??1)/4 and imply a radial gradient of 25\% per astronomical unit. This gradient may be apparent and does not necessarily imply that discontinuities actually occur less frequently at large radial distances. The decreased rate of occurrence may be associated with an increasing thickness of the discontinuities such that they no longer satisfy the identification criteria. Possible evidence of a dependence of ρ on heliographic latitude was sought, but no statistically significant dependence was found. The results of this study are inconsistent with previous inferences of a very large radial or latitudinal gradient on the basis of Pioneer 8 data (Mariani et al., 1973). The reason for this earlier result was probably the influence of time variations which occurred on a scale of several months, as was found in our study, and masqueraded as spatial variations.},

Lett. 101, 025006 (2008)] have shown that the short-scale termination of solar-wind turbulence is characterized by the occurrence of longitudinal electrostatic fluctuations. Beside the ion-acoustic branch, in agreement with solar-wind observations, a novel branch of acoustic-like waves, with phase velocity close to the ion thermal speed, has been recovered in the simulations. In this Letter, we show that these waves turn out to be Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal-like solutions of the hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell equations, driven by kinetic effects of resonant particle trapping. We also discuss the development of the solar-wind turbulent spectra across the ion inertial length and especially stress the fact that turbulence privileges acoustic paths to develop towards short wavelengths.},

In particular the high resolution of solar wind measurements has allowed us to characterize the intermittency observed on small scales. 
 In this paper we will give a schematic view of the main properties of solar wind MHD turbulence and discuss some recent results obtained from the analysis of velocity and magnetic field data measured during the space experiments Helios and ISEE. In particular, we will show that applying Haar wavelets technique to about one year of data taken every minute during the ISEE space experiment, it is possible to calculate spectra and structure functions of the turbulence; moreover the definition of conditioned structure function allows: 
 (a) for the elimination of intermittency effects in spectra and thus for a clear identification of which kind of phenomenology of nonlinear cascade between Kolmogorov and Kraichnan is taking place in the solar wind turbulence; 
 (b) for the identification of the most intermittent structures which turn out to be either shock waves or one-dimensional current sheets, at variance with ordinary fluid intermittency, where the most intermittent structures are found to be two-dimensional vortices.},

We show that most of the dissipation for a given wave-frequency spectrum occurs in the lower corona, and the overall rms amplitude of the fluctuations evolves in a way consistent with observations. The frequency spectrum for a Kolmogorov-like slope is not found to change dramatically from the photosphere to the solar wind; however, it does preserve signatures of transmission throughout the lower atmospheric layers, namely, oscillations in the spectrum at high frequencies reminiscent of the resonances found in the linear case. These may disappear once more realistic couplings for the nonlinear terms are introduced or if time-dependent variability of the lower atmospheric layer is introduced.},

The background solar wind is assigned and two-dimensional shell models are used to describe nonlinear interactions. We find that the turbulent spectra are influenced by the nature of the reflected waves. Close to the base, these give rise to a flatter and steeper spectrum for the outgoing and reflected waves, respectively. At higher heliocentric distance both spectra evolve toward an asymptotic Kolmogorov spectrum. The turbulent dissipation is found to account for at least half of the heating required to sustain the background imposed solar wind and its shape is found to be determined by the reflection-determined turbulent heating below 1.5 solar radii. Therefore, reflection and reflection-driven turbulence are shown to play a key role in the acceleration of the fast solar wind and origin of the turbulent spectrum found at 0.3 AU in the heliosphere.},

If the amplitude of the compressive fluctuations is large enough, Rp crosses one or more instability thresholds for anisotropy-driven micro-instabilities. The enhanced field fluctuations from these micro-instabilities scatter the protons so as to reduce the anisotropy of the pressure tensor, driving the average value of Rp away from the marginal stability boundary until the fluctuating value of Rp stops crossing the boundary. We model this ``fluctuating-anisotropy effect'' using linear Vlasov-Maxwell theory to describe the large-scale compressive fluctuations. We show that this effect can explain why, in the nearly collisionless solar wind, the average value of Rp is close to unity.},

Here kinetic plasma simulations and high-resolution spacecraft observations are compared to facilitate the interpretation of signatures of various dissipation mechanisms. Kurtosis of increments indicates that kinetic scale coherent structures are present, with some suggestion of incoherent activity near ion scales. Conditioned proton temperature distributions suggest heating associated with coherent structures. The results reinforce the association of intermittent turbulence, coherent structures, and plasma dissipation.},

This mode is studied using two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations in a spatially homogeneous plasma model. Theory predicts a threshold electron anisotropy for this instability which depends inversely on the electron parallel ?. The simulations show that wave-particle scattering by enhanced whistler fluctuations maintain the initially bi-Maxwellian character of the electron distribution, and that this scattering imposes an upper bound on the electron T?/T? commensurate with that predicted by linear theory.},

  abstract  = {Weakly collisional space plasmas are rarely in local thermal equilibrium and often exhibit non-Maxwellian electron and ion velocity distributions that lead to the growth of microinstabilities?that is, enhanced electric and magnetic fields at relatively short wavelengths. These instabilities play an active role in the evolution of space plasmas, as does ubiquitous broadband turbulence induced by turbulent structures. This study compares certain properties of a 2.5-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation for the forward cascade of Alfv�nic turbulence in a collisionless plasma against the same properties of turbulence observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission spacecraft in the terrestrial magnetosheath. The PIC simulation is of decaying turbulence that develops both coherent structures and anisotropic ion velocity distributions with the potential to drive kinetic scale instabilities. The uniform background magnetic field points perpendicular to the plane of the simulation. Growth rates are computed from linear theory using the ion temperature anisotropies and ion beta values for both the simulation and the observations. Both the simulation and the observations show that strong anisotropies and growth rates occur highly intermittently in the plasma, and the simulation further shows that such anisotropies preferentially occur near current sheets. This suggests that, though microinstabilities may affect the plasma globally, they act locally and develop in response to extreme temperature anisotropies generated by turbulent structures. Further studies will be necessary to understand why there is an apparent correlation between linear instability theory and strongly intermittent turbulence.},

  abstract   = {The last decade has witnessed a tremendous growths of interests in applications that deal with querying and mining of time series data. Numerous representation methods for dimensionality reduction and similarity measures geared towards time series have been introduced. Each individual work introducing a particular method has made specific claims and, aside from the occasional theoretical justifications, provided quantitative experimental observations. However, for the most part, the comparative aspects of these experiments were too narrowly focused on demonstrating the benefits of the proposed methods over some of the previously introduced ones. In order to provide a comprehensive validation, we conducted an extensive set of time series experiments re-implementing 8 different representation methods and 9 similarity measures and their variants, and testing their effectiveness on 38 time series data sets from a wide variety of application domains. In this paper, we give an overview of these different techniques and present our comparative experimental findings regarding their effectiveness. Our experiments have provided both a unified validation of some of the existing achievements, and in some cases, suggested that certain claims in the literature may be unduly optimistic.},

  abstract = {This paper creates a system for power load forecasting using support vector machine and ant colony optimization. The method of colony optimization is employed to process large amount of data and eliminate redundant information. The system mines the historical daily loading which has the same meteorological category as the forecasting day in order to compose data sequence with highly similar meteorological features. With this method, we reduced SVM training data and overcame the disadvantage of very large data and slow processing speed when constructing SVM model. This paper proposes a new feature selection mechanism based on ant colony optimization in an attempt to combat the aforemention difficulties. The method is then applied to find optimal feature subsets in the fuzzy-rough data reduction process. The present work is applied to complex systems monitoring, the ant colony optimization can mine the data more overall and accurate than the original fuzzy-rough method, an entropy-based feature selector, and a transformation-based reduction method, PCA. Comparing with single SVM and BP neural network in short-term load forecasting, this new method can achieve greater forecasting accuracy. It denotes that the SVM-learning system has advantage when the information preprocessing is based on data mining technology.},

  abstract = {Kinetic Alfv�n waves have been invoked in association with auroral currents and particle acceleration since the pioneering work of Hasegawa [1976]. However, to date, no work has considered the dispersion relation including the full kinetic effects for both electrons and ions. Results from such a calculation are presented, with emphasis on the role of Landau damping in dissipating Alfv�n waves which propagate from the warm plasma of the outer magnetosphere to the cold plasma present in the ionosphere. It is found that the Landau damping is not important when the perpendicular wavelength is larger than the ion acoustic gyroradius and the electron inertial length. In addition, ion gyroradius effects lead to a reduction in the Landau damping by raising the parallel phase velocity of the wave above the electron thermal speed in the short perpendicular wavelength regime. These results indicate that low-frequency Alfv�n waves with perpendicular wavelengths greater than the order of 10 km when mapped to the ionosphere will not be significantly affected by Landau damping. While these results, based on the local dispersion relation, are strictly valid only for short parallel wavelength Alfv�n waves, they do give an indication of the importance of Landau damping for longer parallel wavelength waves such as field line resonances.},

Five weeks later it flew by the Sun at a perihelion distance of 0.166 AU and flyby speed of 95.3�km/s, setting new records as the closest craft to the Sun and the fastest human-made object. In this paper, the overall strategy, plan, process, and early flight results and performance for PSP's flight execution including in-flight trajectory control and re-optimization, orbit determination and navigation, and trajectory correction maneuvers are presented.

  abstract  = {Exploration of the heliosphere and the far reaches of our solar system by the Voyagers and New Horizons and near-Earth observations of the Kuiper Belt and exoplanetary systems have all profoundly changed how we view our own home in space. An Interstellar Probe escaping beyond the solar-system boundaries with new observational techniques would be a bold move in space exploration, enabling detailed, new understanding of the global heliosphere in the context of other astrospheres, further discoveries of unexplored Kuiper Belt Objects, and the first observations of our circumsolar dust disk. These would offer insight into the evolution of the solar system and our understanding of exoplanetary systems. With the power supplies on the Voyagers nearing their end of life, the rapid pace of discovery of exoplanets in other stellar systems, and the evolution in our own understanding brought about by results from the Voyager, Cassini, and Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) spacecraft, the time is right for looking at the next steps we can make into our stellar neighborhood. The question facing us today is what the appropriate next step - a true first step - is in negotiating the transition from science fiction to engineering reality. The scientific imperatives associated with reaching the near interstellar medium in order to understand our origins and our own current locale in the Milky Way trace to the beginnings of the Space Age, and they have been debated and refined since that time and into the current epoch. The subjects of interstellar travel, interstellar probes, and interstellar �precursor� missions are not new but have lacked traction with policy makers and the scientific community at large because of the states of both scientific knowledge and engineering realities. The next step in reaching to the stars will require the recognition of engineering limits, scientific trades, and scientific compromises, but this is new neither in science nor exploration. Such a step would be an �Interstellar Probe.� The time for that step has come.},

  abstract  = {The scientific community has advocated a scientific probe to the interstellar medium for over 30 years. While the Voyager spacecraft have passed through the termination shock of the solar wind, they have limited lifetimes as their radioisotope power supplies decay. It remains unclear whether they can reach the heliopause, the boundary between shocked solar wind and interstellar plasmas, and, in any case, they will not reach the undisturbed interstellar medium. As with most exploratory space missions, their ongoing observations continue to raise even more questions about the nature of the interaction of our heliosphere and the interstellar medium. Scientific questions including:1.What is the nature of the nearby interstellar medium?2.How do the Sun and galaxy affect the dynamics of the heliosphere?3.What is the structure of the heliosphere?4.How did matter in the solar system and interstellar medium originate and evolve?can only be answered by an �interstellar precursor� probe. Such a mission is required to make in situ measurements in the interaction region and interstellar medium itself at distances far from the Sun, but in a finite mission lifetime. By launching a probe toward the incoming �interstellar wind,� whose direction is known, the distance to be traveled can be minimized but is still large. The current consensus is that a scientifically compelling mission must function to at least a distance of 200 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun and return a reasonable stream of data during the voyage. The central problem is that of providing a means of propulsion to accelerate a probe from the Solar System. Even with a low-mass payload and spacecraft, achieving the high speeds needed, even with gravity assists, have remained problematic. Voyager 1, the fastest object ever to leave the system is now traveling ~3.6AU/yr, and a credible probe must reach at least 2�3 times this speed. The use of an Ares V is an approach for enabling a fast interstellar precursor mission. Maximum capability uses the combination of an Ares V, two-engine Centaur upper stage, close fly-by of Jupiter, and radioisotope electric propulsion (REP). Deletion of any of these pieces does not disable the mission, but does increase the flyout time to a given distance. This approach is more robust and provides a faster probe than an earlier alternative, designed for launch by a Delta IV 4050H plus twin Star 48A upper stages.},

  abstract  = {The ongoing Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM) and recent observations from the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) and Cassini missions are providing significant new information about the interaction of the heliosphere with the very local interstellar medium (VLISM). With new observations have come significant new puzzles for describing the interaction physics. Direct measurements of the shocked, solar-wind flow speed are now possible (from Voyager 2) and show the flow remains supersonic. This is one more piece of evidence supporting the idea that the bulk of the energy density in the plasma resides in a non-thermal component that extends to very high energies. There are both quantitative and qualitative implications for the overall heliospheric structure. Observations of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) by IBEX (in Earth orbit) from the interaction region(s) of the solar wind and the VLISM show unexpected structure on a variety of scales. In addition to the general �glow� of the sky in ENAs, IBEX data show a relatively narrow �ribbon� of atomic hydrogen emission from ~200 to ~6keV, roughly circular, but asymmetric in intensity, and centered on an ecliptic longitude ~221 degrees and ecliptic latitude of 39 degrees. The ribbon may be ordered by the interstellar magnetic field. It passes through, rather than being centered on, the �nose� from which the local, neutral interstellar wind enters the Heliosphere, indicating that the flow is not the primary driver of the system as had been thought previously. The neutrals from both the glow and ribbon are also characterized by non-thermal distribution functions. ENAs are observed at higher energies as well by the Ion and Neutral Camera (INCA) on Cassini (in orbit about Saturn). A �belt� of emission, broader than the ribbon but similar to it, is seen up to ~50keV. These observations emphasize the need for in situ measurements to understand the global nature of our local galactic environment, which is much more complex than previously thought. Only an interstellar probe with modern instruments and measurement requirements better defined by these recent observations can provide the new information required. Even more importantly, the broader scale of the interaction as revealed in these measurements suggests much greater flexibility in scientifically allowable, asymptotic trajectories from the heliosphere for the probe. This is a significant relaxation in the trajectory requirements that open up the trade space for Jupiter gravity assists to increase the flyout speeds.},

Various schemes considered require massive propulsion systems and are inherently expensive. We reconsider an old approach in which a small probe obtains significant solar-system escape speeds by �dropping� deep into the Sun's gravitational potential well and then executing a ?V maneuver at perihelion. This implementation requires a very robust and autonomous, yet low-mass spacecraft, as well as an advanced perihelion propulsion system that can be used while the probe is thermally protected from the near-Sun environment. Many of the engineering problems are driven by the need for reliable decades-long cruise in deep space and so are largely independent of the propulsion system. Such a long-lived probe could be queried at random over decades of otherwise hands-off operations and return data obtainable in no other known way on the conditions that exist in the space between the stars.},

This quadratic model matches the measured values of the magnetic field and its curl (current) at each spacecraft, with ? � B zero everywhere, and thus extends the linear curlometer method to second order. Near the spacecraft, it predicts the topology of magnetic structures, such as reconnecting regions or flux ropes, and allows a tracking of the motion of these structures relative to the spacecraft constellation. Comparisons to particle-in-cell simulations estimate the model accuracy. Reconstruction of two electron diffusion regions definitively confirms the expected field line structure. The model can be applied to other small-scale phenomena (e.g., bow shocks) and can also be modified to reconstruct the electric field, allowing tracing of particle trajectories.},

  abstract  = {AbstractIn this study, we apply a new method�the first-order Taylor expansion (FOTE)�to find magnetic nulls and reconstruct magnetic field topology, in order to use it with the data from the forthcoming MMS mission. We compare this method with the previously used Poincare index (PI), and find that they are generally consistent, except that the PI method can only find a null inside the spacecraft (SC) tetrahedron, while the FOTE method can find a null both inside and outside the tetrahedron and also deduce its drift velocity. In addition, the FOTE method can (1) avoid limitations of the PI method such as data resolution, instrument uncertainty (Bz offset), and SC separation; (2) identify 3-D null types (A, B, As, and Bs) and determine whether these types can degenerate into 2-D (X and O); (3) reconstruct the magnetic field topology. We quantitatively test the accuracy of FOTE in positioning magnetic nulls and reconstructing field topology by using the data from 3-D kinetic simulations. The influences of SC separation (0.05~1 di) and null-SC distance (0~1 di) on the accuracy are both considered. We find that (1) for an isolated null, the method is accurate when the SC separation is smaller than 1 di, and the null-SC distance is smaller than 0.25~0.5 di; (2) for a null pair, the accuracy is same as in the isolated-null situation, except at the separator line, where the field is nonlinear. We define a parameter ? = |( ?1 + ?2 + ?3 )|/|?|max in terms of the eigenvalues (?i) of the null to quantify the quality of our method�the smaller this parameter the better the results. Comparing to the previously used parameter (?=|? � B|/|? � B|), ? is more relevant for null identification. Using the new method, we reconstruct the magnetic field topology around a radial-type null and a spiral-type null, and find that the topologies are well consistent with those predicted in theory. We therefore suggest using this method to find magnetic nulls and reconstruct field topology with four-point measurements, particularly from Cluster and the forthcoming MMS mission. For the MMS mission, this null-finding algorithm can be used to trigger its burst-mode measurements.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The Wind spacecraft, launched on November 1, 1994, is a critical element in NASA�s Heliophysics System Observatory (HSO)�a fleet of spacecraft created to understand the dynamics of the Sun-Earth system. The combination of its longevity (>25 years in service), its diverse complement of instrumentation, and high resolution and accurate measurements has led to it becoming the �standard candle� of solar wind measurements. Wind has over 55 selectable public data products with over ~1,100 total data variables (including OMNI data products) on SPDF/CDAWeb alone. These data have led to paradigm shifting results in studies of statistical solar wind trends, magnetic reconnection, large-scale solar wind structures, kinetic physics, electromagnetic turbulence, the Van Allen radiation belts, coronal mass ejection topology, interplanetary and interstellar dust, the lunar wake, solar radio bursts, solar energetic particles, and extreme astrophysical phenomena such as gamma-ray bursts. This review introduces the mission and instrument suites then discusses examples of the contributions by Wind to these scientific topics that emphasize its importance to both the fields of heliophysics and astrophysics.},

  abstract  = {The solar wind shows periods of highly Alfv�nic activity, where velocity fluctuations and magnetic fluctuations are aligned or antialigned with each other. It is generally agreed that solar wind plasma velocity and magnetic field fluctuations observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) during the first encounter are mostly highly Alfv�nic. However, quantitative measures of Alfv�nicity are needed to understand how the characterization of these fluctuations compares with standard measures from prior missions in the inner and outer heliosphere, in fast wind and slow wind, and at high and low latitudes. To investigate this issue, we employ several measures to quantify the extent of Alfv�nicity�the Alfv�n ratio r
A, the normalized cross helicity s

c
, the normalized residual energy s

r
, and the cosine of angle between velocity and magnetic fluctuations . We show that despite the overall impression that the Alfv�nicity is large in the solar wind sampled by PSP during the first encounter, during some intervals the cross helicity starts decreasing at very large scales. These length scales (often >1000d

i
) are well inside inertial range, and therefore, the suppression of cross helicity at these scales cannot be attributed to kinetic physics. This drop at large scales could potentially be explained by large scale shears present in the inner heliosphere sampled by PSP. In some cases, despite the cross helicity being constant down to the noise floor, the residual energy decreases with scale in the inertial range. These results suggest that it is important to consider all these measures to quantify Alfv�nicity.},

  abstract  = {One of the major outstanding questions about magnetic reconnection is where reconnection will occur at the Earth's magnetopause for specific conditions of the solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). There are two scenarios discussed in the literature: (1) antiparallel reconnection, which occurs where the magnetospheric magnetic field and the IMF are antiparallel (shear angle of approximately 180�) and (2) component reconnection, where shear angles between the magnetospheric field and the IMF as low as 50� have been reported. The distinction between the two reconnection scenarios is important for the energy and momentum transfer from the solar wind to the magnetosphere. Here we report on a method using three-dimensional plasma observations from the Toroidal Imaging Mass-Angle Spectrograph instrument on the Polar spacecraft as it passes through the northern magnetospheric cusp to calculate the distance to the reconnection line and subsequently trace the distance along model magnetic field lines back to the magnetopause. Results from 130 events reveal that in general, magnetic reconnection occurs along an extended line across the dayside magnetopause (i.e., consistent with the component reconnection scenario). During strong sunward or antisunward IMF conditions (BX), however, the reconnection location resembles the antiparallel reconnection model at high latitudes and does not cross the dayside magnetopause as a single tilted reconnection line. These results show that either reconnection scenario can occur at the magnetopause, depending on the specific IMF conditions.},

  abstract  = {One of the major questions about magnetic reconnection is how specific         solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field conditions         influence where reconnection occurs at the Earth's magnetopause.         There are two reconnection scenarios discussed in the         literature: a) anti-parallel reconnection and b) component         reconnection. Early spacecraft observations were limited to the         detection of accelerated ion beams in the magnetopause boundary         layer to determine the general direction of the reconnection         X-line location with respect to the spacecraft. An improved view         of the reconnection location at the magnetopause evolved from         ionospheric emissions observed by polar-orbiting imagers. These         observations and the observations of accelerated ion beams         revealed that both scenarios occur at the magnetopause. Improved         methodology using the time-of-flight effect of precipitating         ions in the cusp regions and the cutoff velocity of the         precipitating and mirroring ion populations was used to pinpoint         magnetopause reconnection locations for a wide range of solar         wind conditions. The results from these methodologies have been         used to construct an empirical reconnection X-line model known         as the Maximum Magnetic Shear model. Since this model's         inception, several tests have confirmed its validity and have         resulted in modifications to the model for certain solar wind         conditions. This review article summarizes the observational         evidence for the location of magnetic reconnection at the         Earth's magnetopause, emphasizing the properties and efficacy of         the Maximum Magnetic Shear Model.},

  abstract  = {Daytime high-latitude fluxes of low-energy (<1 kev) electrons and         protons have been observed with the soft particle spectrometer         on the polar satellite Isis 1. These fluxes occur just above the         limit {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}$_{c}$ of closed geomagnetic field         lines in the dayside magnetosphere. The limit         {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}$_{c}$ can be identified through a sharp         decrease in the flux of electrons of somewhat higher energy         ({\ensuremath{\sim}}10 kev). The electron energy spectrum shows         a sharp peak at about 100 to 200 ev, with a total flux of the         order of {}10$^{9}$ electrons cm$^{-2}$ ster$^{-1}$ sec$^{-1}$         carrying an energy of a few tenths of an erg cm$^{-2}$         ster$^{-1}$ sec$^{-1}$. The electron and proton spectral shapes         are shown to be similar to those in the magnetosheath, and for         protons the absolute intensities are approximately equal (no         absolute intensities could be found in the literature for         electrons). The proton spectrum peaks at a slightly higher         energy ({\ensuremath{\sim}}300 ev), again in agreement with         magnetosheath observations. The proton flux is typically         >{}10$^{7}$ cm$^{-2}$ ster$^{-1}$ sec$^{-1}$ with typical energy         fluxes in the range 0.01 to 0.1 ergs cm$^{-2}$ ster$^{-1}$         sec$^{-1}$. It is concluded that solar wind plasma can penetrate         to low altitudes through the high-latitude cusp in the         magnetopause, which is often referred to as the neutral point.         This flux is related to a number of geophysical phenomena,         including magnetospheric surface currents, daytime auroras, VLF         and LF emissions, ionospheric irregularities, and geomagnetic         fluctuations.},

  abstract  = {In this paper we compare observations of the high-latitude cusp from         DMSP data to simulations conducted using the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry         (LFM) global magnetosphere simulation. The LFM simulation is run         for the 31 August 2005 to 02 September 2005 moderate storm, from         which the solar wind data exhibits a wide range of conditions         that enable a statistical representation of the cusp to be         obtained. The location of the cusp is identified using         traditional magnetic depression and plasma density enhancement         at high altitude. A new diagnostic using the parallel ion number         flux is also tested for cusp identification. The correlation of         the cusp latitude and various solar wind interplanetary magnetic         field (IMF) coupling functions is explored using the three         different cusp identification methods. The analysis shows (1)         the three methods give approximately the same location and size         of the simulated cusp at high altitude and (2) the variations of         the simulated cusp are remarkably consistent with the observed         statistical variations of the low-altitude cusp. In agreement         with observations, a higher correlation is obtained using other         solar wind coupling functions such as the Kan-Lee electric         field. The magnetic local time (MLT) position of the simulated         cusp is found to depend upon the IMF B$_{y}$ component, with a         lower linear correlation. The width of the simulated cusp in         both latitude and MLT is also examined. The size of the cusp is         found to increase with the solar wind dynamic pressure with         saturation seen when the dynamic pressure is greater than 3 nPa.},

  abstract  = {Previous work has established that the linear correlation of the low-         altitude particle cusp latitude with the southward component of         the IMF is about 0.70. Several possibly better candidate         functions for determining the coupling between the magnetosphere         and the solar wind have been advanced, but none have been         evaluated in terms of the cusp, which is a site of direct solar         wind-magnetosphere interaction. On the basis of 11 years of DMSP         satellite particle data from 1984-1994 (with verification from         the subsequent 11 years, 1995-2005), we find that the best solar         wind-magnetosphere coupling function involves electric field         dimensions, such as the half wave rectifier (vBs) and the Kan-         Lee electric field (E$_{KL}$ =         vB$_{T}$sin$^{2}$({\ensuremath{\theta}}$_{c}$/2), where         {\ensuremath{\theta}}$_{c}$ is the IMF clock angle). Both the         half wave rectifier (r = 0.77) and the Kan-Lee (r = 0.78)         functions have a linear correlation with cusp latitude which is         noticeably better than the B$_{z}$ function used in previous         work, and also better than the ? parameter (? =         vB$^{2}$sin$^{4}$({\ensuremath{\theta}}$_{c}$/2)). However, the         best correlation is with a function whose clock angle dependence         is intermediate between the pure half wave rectifier (which         implies no merging for B$_{z}$ > 0) and the Kan-Lee function.         Namely, E$_{WAV}$ =         vB$_{T}$sin$^{4}$({\ensuremath{\theta}}$_{c}$/2) correlates with         cusp latitude at the r = 0.81 level. This latter clock angle         dependence has been previously suggested at various times by J.         R. Wygant, by S.-I. Akasofu, and by V. M. Vasyliunas. The         improved result holds for both the equatorward and poleward edge         of the cusp, and regardless of how the IMF is propagated.         Earlier work on cross polar cap potentials and on nightside         auroral luminosity also favored the E$_{WAV}$ function, which in         combination with our findings suggests a widely applicable         result. Dayside merging is thus clearly not purely component         driven, as the half wave rectifier formula implies. These         results also suggest, albeit less convincingly, that merging         shuts down for increasingly northward IMF more rapidly than the         Kan-Lee electric field implies.},

Macroscopic features such as thickness, location, and motion of the magnetopause were calculated as a function of local time sector. The results show that the flanks of the magnetopause are significantly thicker than the dayside magnetopause. Thicknesses vary from about 650 km near noon to over 1,000 km near the terminator. Current densities vary in a similar manner, with average current densities around noon almost twice as high as near the terminator. We also find a dawn-dusk asymmetry in many of the macroscopic parameters; the dawn magnetopause is thicker than at dusk, while the dusk flank is more dynamic, with a higher average normal velocity.},

  abstract = {We report an accelerated plasma flow event detected by Wind at the low-         latitude dawn tail magnetopause         (x$_{GSE}$\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde-10R$_{E}$) when the         local magnetic shear across the magnetopause was high         (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde180{\textdegree}) and the GSM y         component of the interplanetary magnetic field was positive and         much larger than the z component. High time resolution (3 s)         three-dimensional ion and electron distributions were obtained         for this event. We have performed rigorous tests of fluid and         particle predictions of reconnection. Consistent with         reconnection, we observed at the magnetopause (1) jetting of         plasma, with a flow speed, measured in the deHoffmann-Teller         frame, at 98\% of the Alfv{\'e}n speed; (2) mixing of a nearly         isotropic hot plasma sheet ion distribution with a field-aligned         magnetosheath distribution having a low-energy cutoff at the         predicted deHoffmann-Teller velocity; (3) opposite streaming of         magnetosheath and plasma sheet electrons consistent with open         field topology; and (4) a finite inward (earthward) directed         normal magnetic field (B$_{N}$<0) at and an associated earthward         plasma flow (at 94\% of the normal Alfv{\'e}n speed) across the         magnetopause. The combined fluid and particle signatures provide         a comprehensive set of evidence for reconnection at the         magnetopause. These reconnection signatures were observed in the         tail flank magnetopause, where the presence of fast plasma flow         (at almost twice the local Alfv{\'e}n speed) in the adjacent         magnetosheath has been predicted to suppress reconnection. The         sense of the flow enhancement, the direction of the electron         heat flux, and the polarity of B$_{N}$ are all consistent with         each other and with the spacecraft being located tailward and         northward of the reconnection site. Our analysis places the         reconnection site \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde7 Earth radii         south of the magnetic equator. The dimensionless reconnection         rate at this flank magnetopause is estimated to be in the range         of 0.1 to 0.2, which is similar to values reported for the         subsolar region. In essence, the present event provides         unambiguous evidence for reconnection and shows that         reconnection signatures at the tail flank magnetopause are not         noticeably different from those predicted and observed in the         subsolar region.},

  abstract = {Abstract Observations at the reconnection site from the MMS mission are used to examine the occurrence of magnetic reconnection along the magnetopause in relation to both the upstream IMF orientation and local magnetosheath variations. While there is a statistically larger number of reconnection intervals observed downstream of the quasi-parallel bow shock than is accounted for based on the histogram of overall IMF orientations, it is surmised that increased fluctuations downstream of the quasi-parallel bow shock cause greater large-scale motion of the magnetopause surface; but do not preferentially enhance the occurrence of steady magnetic reconnection. An examination of the locations of observed reconnection sites relative to model predictions also suggest that enhanced magnetosheath fluctuations do not result in steady reconnection occurring at random locations at the magnetopause.

We examined the magnetopause crossings that         occurred during the first year of the mission in the 0600-1800         LT interval and we identified plasma flows, at the magnetopause         or in the boundary layer, with a different velocity with respect         to the adjacent magnetosheath. We used the Wal{\'e}n relation to         test which of these flows could be generated by magnetic         reconnection. For some event we observed opposite-directed         reconnection jets, which could be associated with the passage of         the X-line near the satellite. We analyzed the occurrence of the         reconnection jets and reconnection jet reversals in relation to         the magnetosheath parameters, in particular the local Alfv{\`e}n         Mach number, the plasma {\ensuremath{\beta}}, and the magnetic         shear angle. We also studied the positions and velocities of the         reconnection jets and jet reversals in relation to the         magnetosheath magnetic field clock angle. We found that the         observations indicate the presence of a reconnection line hinged         near the subsolar point and tilted according to the observed         magnetosheath clock angle, consistently with the component         merging model.},
